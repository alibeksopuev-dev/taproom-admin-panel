# Restore Context Prompt

I am taking over development of the `taproom-admin-v3` project located at `/Users/alibek/WebstormProjects/taproom-admin-v3`.
The project uses FSD architecture, React, Vite, Supabase, and RTK Query.
The current state is documented in `docs/walkthrough.md` in the project root.
Please read `docs/walkthrough.md` and `src/app/router.tsx` to understand the implemented features (Auth, Sidebar, Categories List).
My next task is to implement the Create/Edit forms for Categories.
